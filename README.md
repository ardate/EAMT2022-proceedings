# Proceedings of the EAMT 2020 
22nd Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation


# ACL Anthology

The proceedings and all the corresponding papers are also available into the ACL Anthology. 
Peer-reviewing was done using EasyChair, but proceedings are to be produced with ACLPUB.
The `ACLPUB` directory contains the followed procedure, according to the import instructions avaliable [here](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/info/contrib/)
  
We have adapted the script `easy2acl.py` available at https://github.com/acl-org/easy2acl to our needs.

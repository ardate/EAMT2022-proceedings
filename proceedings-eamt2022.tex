\chapter*{Foreword from the General Chair}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword from the General Chair}
%\vspace{-0.8cm}

\begin{onehalfspacing}
As president of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT) and General Chair of the 23rd Annual Conference of the EAMT, it is with great pleasure that I write these opening words to the Proceedings of EAMT 2022 (a first time for me!). The preparations for EAMT 2022 were initially started by the former President, Mikel Forcada, to whom I am deeply grateful for all the assistance and hand over.

A first note of appreciation and gratitude to the Executive Board Members who have moved to new plans in life, after long and outstanding dedicated service to the EAMT community. Firstly, Tony Clarke, EAMT treasurer for 23 years, in appreciation for his invaluable service as the longest-standing treasurer of our Association. To Andy Way, in appreciation for his years of service as secretary, president, conference organizer, and member of the Executive Board of our Association. To Viggo Hansen, our gratitude for his years of service as secretary, conference organizer, and member of the Executive Board of our Association. 

One of the most significant milestones this year was the John Hutchins Machine Translation Archive new domain, an achievement built upon the hard work of our former president, Mikel Forcada, and a group of dedicated members, Barry Haddow, Leopoldo Pla, and Matt Post. The John Hutchins Machine Translation Archive is alive at: \url{https://mt-archive.net/}. We invite our community to visit John's archive!

A few lines more of gratitude to Matt Post, for being responsible for the import of the MT Archive conference proceedings into the ACL anthology. Our community is very thankful to Matt Post for the massive import work and patience along the way!

Now our EAMT 2022 event! After an online-edition in Lisbon, in 2020 (in which I had no opportunity to welcome you in person as a co-chair) and a cancellation in 2021, we now move forward to a fully and much hoped for live event in Ghent, Belgium! Winds of change in the pandemics are bringing a new hope. Embedded in this spirit, the local organizers are enthusiastic about hosting an in-person event, after the two-years interregnum, anticipating a much needed gathering of the community. Let us hope that these changes are here to stay. 

Despite the positive changes in terms of covid, our community reached out to us requesting for support, specifically for freelance translators and/or members from low-income areas and war zones. For the first time, we have opened two calls for grants, encompassing, on one hand, students from Translation Studies and, on another, members from Middle East and African countries. A total of seven grants were given. We hope this initiative may mitigate the hard times we are living and may bring richer discussions into our EAMT 2022, diversifying geographically our membership.

EAMT 2022 will have a three-day, four-track programme put together by our chairs: Löic Barrault and Marta Costa-Jussà, research track co-chairs; Ellie Kemp and Spyridon Pilos, user track co-chairs; Maarit Koponen and Christophe Declercq, translator track co-chairs; and Mikel Forcada, as the projects/products track chair. Carolina Scarton, Secretary of EAMT, was the chair of the Best Thesis Award and also the technical coordinator of the reviewing process (our gratitude to Carolina who is always willing to support our community).

This year, the programme will also include two keynotes speakers, invited by Lieve Macken and Andrew Rufener (with our full support and enthusiasm), Laura Rossi (Medtronic) and Jörg Tiedemann (University of Helsinki), combining industry and academia visions on the field, a true honour to have them and to be able to discuss their talks in person.

EAMT 2022 brings a new breeze of hope and it is the result of the hard work of our local organizers from the Language and Translation Technology Team (LT3) of Ghent University and CrossLang. Our gratitude and appreciation to the LT3 team, Lieve Macken (co-chair), Joke Daems, Arda Tezcan, and Bram Vanroy; and to the CrossLang team, Andrew Rufener (co-chair), Joachim Van den Bogaert, and especially to Martine Massiera for her outstanding work taking care of our sponsors, registration process, all social events, and smoothly handling the logistics of the new calls for grants. 

EAMT has been supported by generous sponsors in its initiatives along the years. This year is no exception. Our gratitude to our sponsors: Microsoft (platinum sponsor, who will also be giving a talk entitled ``Microsoft and Translators' quest to break down language barriers''), Pangeanic and Yamagata (silver sponsors), STAR Group and Unbabel (bronze sponsors), Apertium (collaborator sponsor), Springer (best paper award supporter) and MultiLingual (media sponsor).

A final note to our participants! By the time I am writing these lines, there are already 113 participants and the number continues growing! Even in unstable times, this number is a very positive sign! We can finally meet in person! Let us take this opportunity to revive fruitful discussions, scientific collaborations, and constructive feedback in our community. I'm looking forward to seeing you all, finally!

\chapter*{Message from the Organising Committee Chairs}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Message from the Organising Committee Chairs}
%\vspace{-0.9cm}


\begin{onehalfspacing}
It is with great pleasure that we finally welcome you in Ghent to attend the 23rd Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation.
 
The idea of organizing the 23rd Annual Conference of EAMT in Ghent jointly by the LT3 research team and CrossLang emerged in 2019 at the Croke Park stadium in Dublin where we enjoyed the Gala Dinner of the MT Summit. Unfortunately, COVID-19 prevented us from organizing an on-site event and EAMT2021 was first postponed and eventually cancelled. We are therefore extremely pleased to be able to welcome you all in our beautiful city for EAMT2022 and to meet you all in person.
 
A lot can happen in two years. The venue we had originally booked, the Aula Academica of Ghent University, a historic building of 1826, was no longer available due to renovation work. As Ghent is a great mix of old and new, we instead welcome you in the trendy Zebrastraat and keep the historic part for the conference dinner, which will be organized in the church of Monasterium PoortAckere. 
 
People also change jobs. With a new team (and a new EAMT president) we continued the preparations for the conference. We kept the basic format of previous editions, but added a second keynote speaker. This not only allowed us to find the optimal balance between academia and industry but also ensured gender balance. We are really looking forward to the talks of Jörg Tiedemann and Laura Rossi.
 
We did not opt for a hybrid conference as the advantages did not outweigh the disadvantages. As a compromise, we will record the oral sessions and make the recordings available after the conference. 
 
We would express our sincerest gratitude to everyone who made EAMT2022 possible: Mikel Forcada as former president of EAMT; Helena Moniz as new president of EAMT; Carolina Scarton as EAMT Secretary; Löic Barrault and Marta Costa-Jussà as research track chairs; Ellie Kemp and Spyridon Pilos as user track co-chairs; Maarit Koponen and Christophe Declercq as translator track chairs.  
 
We extend our thanks to our sponsors for their invaluable support: Microsoft (Platinum sponsor), Pangeanic and Yamagata (Silver sponsors), STAR Group and Unbabel (Bronze sponsors), Apertium (Collaborator sponsor), Springer (Supporter sponsor), and MultiLingual (media sponsor).
 
This conference would not have been possible without the hard work of all members of the joint organizing team: Andrew Rufener, Martine Massiera and Joachim Van den Bogaert of CrossLang; Lieve Macken, Joke Daems, Arda Tezcan, Bram Vanroy and Margot Fonteyne of the Language and Translation Technology Team (LT³) of Ghent University. Sincere thanks as well to Sam Delmotte of Ghent University for recording the oral sessions.

\chapter*{Preface by the Programme Chairs}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface by the Programme Chairs}


\begin{onehalfspacing}
On behalf of the programme chairs, a warm welcome to the 23rd annual conference of the European Association for Machine Translation in Ghent, Belgium. After all the restrictions, rescheduling and cancellations of events in the past couple of years, and after a prolonged period with almost all meetings online, we are delighted to finally be meeting our colleagues face-to-face again!

Following the approach which has proven so successful in the previous editions of EAMT, the conference programme consists of papers and posters divided into four tracks. These relate to research, users, translators and projects/products.

The research track this year was one of the most competitive tracks ever in the history of EAMT. Only 17 out of 39 papers were accepted (an acceptance rate of 44\%), based on three-peer reviews. The papers describe state-of-the-art work being conducted and, therefore, are highly relevant to our community.  Eight papers will be presented orally and nine as posters, as you may already find in the programme. We invite our community to reach out to the authors and discuss the relevant work conducted in such a demanding track.

The submissions for the user track in this edition mostly tackle the customer support domain - a particular focus of the oral sessions of the programme - and industry usage of MT. This track will discuss a number of practical issues for users. These range from the notion of “users” in a very challenging domain, to conversational data with strict time constraints, and the quality of the MT produced.

The translator's track, as is evident from the name, emphasises the perspective of translators on MT. This year, the track features three peer-reviewed papers, each of which addresses aspects of machine translation and post-editing carried out by translators in different settings. The diverging uses of post-editing and machine translation cover a survey of corporate use of post-editing and revision in the NMT era, post-editing practices for automatically generated subtitles, and annotation of post-editing and machine translation errors using speech-to-text technology.

Forty-four papers were submitted to the largest ever project/product track in the history of EAMT conferences. Of them, 41 were eventually accepted, some of them after an additional round of improvements with the general audience of EAMT in sight. As these lines are written, authors are preparing their posters, and also their poster booster slides, in anticipation of their (strictly-timed) two minutes of glory before the poster session.

In addition to the papers and posters relating to the different tracks, the programme also features two fascinating invited talks: Laura Rossi with her talk titled ``I once said to my boss `SMT will never work...' '' and Jörg Tiedemann with ``Democratizing machine translation with OPUS-MT''.

We wish to thank the members of the scientific programme committee for their time and support, and for their invaluable expertise in peer-reviewing the submissions. Our thanks naturally go to all the authors, without whom the programme would not exist, the local organisers for all their hard work, as well as Carol Scarton, Helena Moniz and Mikel Forcada for their unfailing advice and support.

\section*{Democratizing machine translation with OPUS-MT}
\textbf{Jörg Tiedemann}, University of Helsinki, Finland
\vspace{0.5cm}

The demand for translation is ever growing and this trend will not stop. Being able to access the same kind of information is a fundamental prerequisite for equality in society and translation plays a crucial role when fighting discrimination based on language barriers. Efficient tools and a better coverage of the linguistic diversity in the World are necessary to cope with the amount of material that needs to be handled. Our mission is to support the development of high quality tools for automatic and computer-assisted translation by providing open services and resources that are independent of commercial interests and profit-driven companies. Equal information access is a human right and not only a privilege for people who can pay for it. In this talk I will discuss the current state of OPUS-MT, our project on open neural machine translation and the challenges that we try to tackle with multilingual NLP, transfer learning and data augmentation. I will report about on-going work on knowledge distillation, the creation of compact models for real-time translation and our work on modularization of neural MT.


\section*{``I once said to my boss `SMT will never work...' ''}
\textbf{Laura Rossi}, Medtronic 
\vspace{0.5cm}

I once said to my boss: `SMT will never work...', yet here we are: after being statistical, MT became neural and even adaptive, and achieved levels of quality that were unthinkable 20 years ago, covering, in addition, more and more language pairs every day. Customizations of MT systems have turned into a commodity, made available through specialized companies, LSPs and even as a self-service model. MT is very well integrated in human translation workflows to lower prices and shorten turnarounds. So, what are users, and in particular corporate users, looking for next? What creates a differentiative and appealing offer? What makes them choose for one or the other vendor? The race is moving towards automation, integration, well-being and sustainability.


\chapter*{EAMT 2020 and EAMT 2021 Best Thesis Award — Anthony C Clarke Award}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{EAMT 2020 and EAMT 2021 Best Thesis Award — Anthony C Clarke Award}


\begin{onehalfspacing}

Despite not having an EAMT conference in 2021, we still had the EAMT Best Thesis Awards for PhD theses defended in 2020. Therefore, this EAMT 2022 proceedings contains the abstracts for the winners of both EAMT 2020 and EAMT 2021 Best Thesis Award (Anthony C Clarke Award). 

Four PhD theses defended in 2020 were received as candidates for the 2020 edition of the Anthony C Clarke Award – EAMT Best Thesis Award, and all four were eligible. Eight EAMT Executive Committee members were recruited to examine and score the theses, considering how challenging the problem tackled in each thesis was, how relevant the results were for machine translation as a field, and what the strength of its impact in terms of scientific publications was. Two EAMT Executive Committee members also analysed all theses.

The scores of the best theses were extremely close, which made it very hard to select a single winner. A panel of seven EAMT Executive Committee members (Khalil Sima'an, Barry Haddow, Celia Rico, Lieve Macken, Carolina Scarton, Helena Moniz and Mikel L. Forcada) was assembled to process and discuss the reviews.

The panel has decided to have two ex aequo winners for the 2020 edition of the EAMT Best Thesis Award:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maha Elbayad}: \textit{Rethinking the Design of Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Efficient Machine Translation} (University Grenoble Alpes, France) — supervised by Laurent Besacier and Jakob Verbeek
    \item \textbf{Mattia Antonino Di Gangi}: \textit{Neural Speech Translation: From Neural Machine Translation to Direct Speech Translation} (University of Trento, Italy) — supervised by Marcello Federico, Marco Turchi and Matteo Negri
\end{itemize}

Six PhD theses defended in 2021 were received as candidates for the 2021 edition of the Anthony C Clarke Award for the EAMT Best Thesis, and all six were eligible. 12 reviewers and five EAMT Executive Committee members were recruited to examine and score the theses, considering how challenging the problem tackled in each thesis was, how relevant the results were for machine translation as a field, and what the strength of its impact in terms of scientific publications was. Two EAMT Executive Committee members (Helena Moniz – EAMT President – and Carolina Scarton – EAMT Secretary) formed a panel to analyse all theses and discuss all reviews.

The year of 2021 was again a very good year for PhD theses in machine translation. The scores of the best theses were very close, which made it very hard to select a winner. After discussing all the theses and their reviews, the panel proposed a winner that was approved by the EAMT executive committee, represented by members André Martins, Barry Haddow, Celia Rico, Lieve Macken, Lucia Specia and Heidi Depraetere. The awardee of the 2021 edition of the EAMT Best Thesis is \textbf{Danielle Saunders'} thesis \textit{Domain Adaptation for Neural Machine Translation} (University of Cambridge, UK), supervised by Professor Bill Byrne.

We are very grateful to all reviewers that helped in assessing the theses defended in 2021 and provided their invaluable and high quality feedback.
